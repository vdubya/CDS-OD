<NPR>NOTE:  NOTE:  The Contracting Officer shall furnish the Contractor, in the contract 
documents, an initial Microbial Assessment Survey with containment categories 
and remediation methods specified for each work area and material within the 
work area.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Contracting Officer's initial Microbial Assessment Survey specified below 
shall be furnished and certified by a qualified assessor authorized by the Contracting 
Officer to do such work.  The initial survey shall be included in the solicitation 
documents at the end of this specification section.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Contracting Officer shall ensure that in the initial survey a cost analysis 
that identifies the potential for replacement of the contaminated items versus 
remediation is provided.  This information shall not be shared with the contractor.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Contracting Officer must require that the microbial assessor provide documentation 
proving that the assessor meets at least one of the following criteria:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1.  Bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college with a major 
in engineering, architecture, building construction, occupational health, microbiology, 
occupational safety, or a related natural or physical science.  Additionally, 
two years experience in conducting microbial investigations is required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2.  Associates degree from an accredited university or college with a concentration 
in environmental, natural or physical sciences.  Additionally, four years experience 
in conducting microbial investigations is required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>3.  Certification as an industrial hygienist (CIH) as certified by the American 
Board of Industrial Hygienists, safety professional (CSP) as certified by the 
Board of Certified Safety Professionals or engineer (PE).  Additionally, one 
year experience in conducting microbial investigations is required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>4.  Certification by the American Council for Accredited Certification (ACAC) 
as a Council-Certified Indoor Environmental Consultant (CIEC), Council-Certified 
Indoor Environmentalist (CIE), Council-Certified Microbial Consultant (CMC), 
Council-Certified Microbial Investigator (CMI), Council-Certified Residential 
Mold Inspector (CRMI), Council-Certified Microbial Remediation Supervisor (CMRS) 
or Council-Certified Microbial Remediator (CMR).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The procedures detailed in this specification are intended to be used for mold 
remediation projects in buildings occupied by the general population.  This 
specification section may be a starting point for a project specification covering 
the requirements for removal of mold contaminated materials in facilities where 
sensitive populations will re-occupy the facility after remediation.  Designer/Specifier 
will consult with the customer to determine if sensitive populations are present 
in the facility.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Sensitive populations as used here include those with health deficiencies such 
as people with immune deficiencies.  Facilities where they are found include 
hospital wings and medical clinics.  Children in day care centers or senior 
citizens in nursing homes are also examples of sensitive populations.</NPR><BRK/>
 <BRK/>
<NPR>For application to such sensitive facilities, the requirements for clearance 
and verification of removal of mold contaminated materials must meet the more 
stringent sampling requirements of Appendix B.</NPR><BRK/>
 <BRK/>
<NPR>Prior to completing these specifications for facilities with sensitive populations, 
designer/specifier should consult with doctors, infection control, and risk 
management staff, Government Industrial Hygienist and Occupational, and Environmental 
Medicine Physician from the supporting Military Treatment Facility (MTF) familiar 
with or responsible for operation of the facilities.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Information regarding the types of mold found growing in the spaces may be used 
by the medical staff to determine the level of risk of the population, and help 
determine the requirements for verification of the remediation project.</NPR><BRK/>
 <BRK/>
<NPR>Review and repair, if necessary, of HVAC and Building Envelope systems to prevent 
moisture incursions which could create conditions suitable for future mold growth 
must be included as part of any mold remediation project, but are not included 
as part of this specification.</NPR><BRK/>
 <BRK/>
<NPR>The following information shall be shown on the project drawings:</NPR><BRK/>
 <BRK/>
<NPR>The project drawings shall clearly show the location and extent of mold contamination 
and the materials to be removed.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The Designer should include unit price items to address mold remediation.  
Include unit price items for removal and cleaning (e.g., drywall removal, ceiling 
tile removal, carpet removal, non-porous surface cleaning, semi-porous surface 
cleaning).  Estimate the quantity and specify as unit price items in Section 
00 21 13, INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS or Section <SRF>01 20 00.00 20</SRF> Price and Payment 
Procedures per standard practice of the activity preparing the contract.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The work may involve a historic property.  The designer must coordinate 
review of the proposed work with the appropriate cultural resources manager 
(CRM) and cultural resource laws and regulations, as part of the environmental 
review and permitting process.  Consultation with stakeholders, including the 
state historic preservation office, may be required, and work involving historic 
properties will likely be required to confirm to the Secretary of the Interior's 
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (usually at the REHABILITATION 
level). See <URL>https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-<BRK/>

<BRK/>
<NPR>For subparagraphs (3)(d), (3)(e) and (3)(f), determine the source of makeup 
air to the remediation area.  The sampling protocol must be structured to compare 
the airborne fungal concentrations of the air entering the remediation work 
area, prior to commencement of remediation work, with the concentrations found 
in the work area after remediation is complete.  Sampling times must be limited 
to prevent drying out of the media being used.  Consult with the laboratory 
performing the analysis of samples to determine the appropriate sampling methods 
and times.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>3.8.3.1 Clearance</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a. Clearance Criteria</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Clearance will be based on visual assessment, and surface and air sampling for 
fungi.  Clearance fungal sampling results are included in the respective paragraphs 
below.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(1) Visual Assessment.  Contracting Officer will verify that all visible mold 
and all visible dust has been removed.  Contracting Officer may use a "white 
glove" test to verify that mold and dust have been removed.  "White glove" test 
will consist of wiping the surface with a clean cloth of color suitable to reveal 
expected type of dust.  For most surfaces, a white cloth is suitable.  For GWB 
dust, a dark cloth may be more appropriate.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(2) Surface Sampling.  Contracting Officer will collect tape-lift surface samples 
to determine if fungal growth structures are still present on surfaces.  Results 
of tape lift samples will be considered acceptable if fungal growth structures 
are not present.  Detail quantity and location of tape surface samples in Microbial 
Remediation Plan.  The Designer should research and verify an appropriate number 
of clearance samples is specified to ensure the protection of the sensitive 
population.  A minimum of 5 samples per<MET> 93 square meters</MET><ENG> 1000 square feet</ENG> of 
gypsum wallboard removed must be collected.  For ductwork, one sample for every 
10 variable air volume terminals and one sample for every<MET> 18.6 square meters</MET><ENG>
 200 square feet</ENG> of ductwork must be collected.  These sample numbers should 
be adjusted for the specific application.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(3) Air Sampling Clearance Criteria</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(a) Prior to  the remediation process, microbial assessor must collect baseline 
bulk or surface samples from contaminated materials for culture on fungal growth 
media for laboratory analysis to determine the predominant fungal species growing 
in the areas being remediated.  The predominant fungal species are the "marker" 
species for clearance air sampling after remediation.  Consult with the laboratory 
performing the analysis of samples to determine the appropriate marker species 
in the sample data.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(b) In consultation with the laboratory performing the analysis, microbial assessor 
must determine the appropriate sampling method, including sample media and sample 
time and culture temperature for the marker species.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(c) In consultation with the laboratory performing the analysis, medical health 
professionals, infection control staff, industrial hygienists and microbial 
assessor must determine the clearance criteria for the marker species.  The 
clearance criteria will be based on the limits of detection possible with the 
sampling method used and the occupant population expected after remediation 
is complete.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(d) After remediation is complete, but prior to removing AFUs, collect air samples 
in the areas remediated,[ in adjacent areas providing makeup air to the remediation 
area,] and in the outdoor air for laboratory analysis.  Adjust sampling times 
in the remediation area samples to account for the expected low particle counts 
in the air.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(e) For ductwork cleaning projects, supply clean filtered air from an AFU to 
the ductwork-do not use air from the air handling unit or room air.  Samples 
must be collected using a hood or other device that allows sampling of air that 
comes from the ductwork and not from the room.</NPR><NED/><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(f) Compare results of remediation area samples with the results of samples 
collected in outdoor air[ and adjacent areas providing makeup air].  Concentrations 
of fungal species in the remediation areas must be less than the clearance criteria 
determined in the paragraph AIR SAMPLING CLEARANCE CRITERIA.</NPR><BRK/>
