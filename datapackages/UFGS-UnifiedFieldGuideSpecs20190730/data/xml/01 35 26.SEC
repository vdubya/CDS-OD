<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>safety and occupational 
health requirements for the protection of Contractor and Government personnel, 
property, and resources</SCP>.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This guide specification is intended for use in contracts that specify FAR 52.236-13 
Accident Prevention, or its Alternate I, to include contracts for construction, 
dismantling, renovation and demolition; dredging; environmental restoration 
(investigation, design, remediation); asbestos abatement or lead hazard control; 
projects in the continental U.S. and overseas.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The requirements of this guide specification supplement U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE) Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1, and clarify safety 
concerns for high-risk construction activities.<BRK/>

Standard when editing this guide specification or preparing new project specification 
sections.  Edit this guide specification for project specific requirements by

<NPR>NOTE:  Include other referenced sections in the contract where work, such as 
environmental restoration, asbestos abatement or lead hazard control, requires 
additional safety and health plans to be made part of and appended to the APP.  
These sections include Section <SRF>01 35 29.13</SRF> HEALTH, SAFETY, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
PROCEDURES FOR CONTAMINATED SITES for environmental restoration project; Section 
<SRF>02 82 00</SRF> ASBESTOS REMEDIATION, for asbestos abatement; Section <SRF>02 83 00</SRF> LEAD 
REMEDIATION for lead hazard control activities; and Section <SRF>02 85 00</SRF> MOLD REMEDIATION.  
For NAVY environmental restoration contracts, an APP is required with the overall 
contract and a site specific Health and Safety Plan is required for each task 
order (contact the FEAD Safety Manager for applicability).<BRK/>

Many states and municipalities have more stringent or additional requirements;  
modify this section as required to meet local requirements and regulations.</NPR><BRK/>

PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,  Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<TXT>A qualified person must prepare the written site-specific APP.  Prepare the APP in accordance with the format 
and requirements of <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>, Appendix A, and as supplemented herein.  Cover all paragraph and subparagraph 
elements in <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>, Appendix A<TAI OPT="NASA">[ and show compliance with <RID>NASA NPR 8715.3</RID>]</TAI>.  The APP must be job-specific 
and address any unusual or unique aspects of the project or activity for which it is written.  The APP must interface 
with the Contractor's overall safety and health program referenced in the APP in the applicable APP element, 
and made site-specific.  Describe the methods to evaluate past safety performance of potential subcontractors 
in the selection process.  Also, describe innovative methods used to ensure and monitor safe work practices of 
subcontractors.  The Government considers the Prime Contractor to be the "controlling authority" for all work 
site safety and health of the subcontractors.  Contractors are responsible for informing their subcontractors 
of the safety provisions under the terms of the contract and the penalties for noncompliance, coordinating the 
work to prevent one craft from interfering with or creating hazardous working conditions for other crafts, and 
inspecting subcontractor operations to ensure that accident prevention responsibilities are being carried out.  
The APP must be signed by an officer of the firm (Prime Contractor senior person), the individual preparing the 
APP, the on-site superintendent, the designated SSHO, the Contractor Quality Control Manager, and any designated 
Certified Safety Professional (CSP) or Certified Health Physicist (CIH).  The SSHO must provide and maintain 
the APP and a log of signatures by each subcontractor foreman, attesting that they have read and understand the 
APP, and make the APP and log available on-site to the Contracting Officer.  If English is not the foreman's 
primary language, the Prime Contractor must provide an interpreter.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>Submit the APP to the Contracting Officer <TAI OPT="ARMY">[</TAI>15<TAI OPT="ARMY">] [_____]</TAI> calendar days prior to the date of the preconstruction 
conference for acceptance.  Work cannot proceed without an accepted APP.  Once reviewed and accepted by the Contracting 
Officer, the APP and attachments will be enforced as part of the contract.  Disregarding the provisions of this 
contract or the accepted APP is cause for stopping of work, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, until 
the matter has been rectified.  Continuously review and amend the APP, as necessary, throughout the life of the 
contract.  Changes to the accepted APP must be made with the knowledge and concurrence of the Contracting Officer, 
project superintendent, SSHO and Quality Control Manager.  Incorporate unusual or high-hazard activities not 
identified in the original APP as they are discovered.  Should any severe hazard exposure (i.e. imminent danger) 
become evident, stop work in the area, secure the area, and develop a plan to remove the exposure and control 
the hazard.  Notify the Contracting Officer within 24 hours of discovery.  Eliminate and remove the hazard.  
In the interim, take all necessary action to restore and maintain safe working conditions in order to safeguard 
onsite personnel, visitors, the public (as defined by <RID>ASSP A10.34</RID>), and the environment.</TXT><BRK/>
