<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification supplements UFGS <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES, 
tailored for Design/Build projects.  Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> covers general procedures 
primarily with respect to construction submittals.  This section provides requirements 
for design submittals and design quality procedures.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>In addition, the guide specification serves as a stand-alone reference point 
for all BIM, CIM, GIS, and/or CAD-related requirements for a project.  Consult 
all appropriate agency guidance and policies as well as stakeholder requirements 
to determine the components of this specification to retain for a particular 
project.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>Thoroughly edit this section throughout and coordinate with any other related 
or referencing specifications. Commonly related specifications that may contain 
BIM, CIM, GIS, and/or CAD-related requirements include but are not limited to

<BRK/>
<TXT>After award, develop the accepted proposal into the completed design, as described herein.  Use a collaborative, 
integrated design process for all stages of project delivery with comprehensive performance goals for site development, 
energy, water, material selection, indoor environmental quality, and waste diversion.  Ensure incorporation of 
these goals in project delivery.  Consider all stages of the building lifecycle, including deconstruction, rehabilitation, 
re-purposing, or demolition.</TXT><BRK/>

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
When a "D" follows a submittal item, it indicates Designer of Record Approval 
(DA) is required for that item.  When a "C" follows a submittal item, it indicates 
Government Conformance Review of Design (CR) is required for that item.  When 
an "R" follows a submittal item, it indicates both a Designer of Record Approval 
and Government Conformance Review (DA/CR) is required for that item.  When an 
"A" follows a submittal item, it indicates both a Designer of Record Approval 
and Government Approval (DA/GA) is required for that item.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">a.  Utilize GSA Schedule manufacturers and products in selection of FF&amp;E for this project.  Open 
market sources can be specified when an item is not available on GSA Schedule, minimize use ($3,000 per 
line item/$25,000 per contract) and do not specify without written justification.  Make a concerted effort 
to exclude items with proprietary features which would prevent competition.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">b.  Specify furnishings from within a manufacturer's family wherever possible while ensuring aesthetic, 
quality and functionality are not compromised.  For example:  Steelcase, Turnstone, Brayton International, 
Metro, and Vecta are all Steelcase companies.  Each alternate should also be specified from a manufacturer's 
family of furniture, example:  first set of alternates would be specified from Knoll's family of furniture 
and the second from Herman Miller family of furniture.  Select office furniture, including case goods, 
tables, storage, and seating, that is compatible in style, finish and color.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">c.  It is acceptable to make selections from other than a manufacturer's family of furniture where costs 
are not reasonable for particular items, some items are not available or appropriate for the facility, 
or the items are not on GSA Schedule.  If this occurs, specify product from an open line that is accessible 
by numerous dealerships.</LST><BRK/>

<TXT>Provide the design package in letter size format using three-ring binders with pockets on the inside of the cover.  
Provide project binder cover and spine inserts sheets identifying the document as "<SUB>Furniture, Fixtures &amp;

phase and date.  Include a footer on all text documents that lists the project name, location, date and submittal 
phase.  See paragraph SUBMITTAL COMPONENTS on Color Boards for additional requirements.  Use more than one binder 
when there are numerous pages with thick samples.  Large D-ring binders are preferred to O-ring binders.  Use 
color board material that is strong enough to keep pages from tearing out.  Anchor large or heavy samples with 
mechanical fasteners, Velcro, or double-faced foam tape rather than rubber cement or glue.  Fold out items may 
have a maximum spread of<MET> 650 mm</MET><ENG> 25-1/2 inches</ENG>.  Produce drawings in an<MET> A3</MET><ENG> 11 x 17 inch</ENG> format size.  See paragraph
