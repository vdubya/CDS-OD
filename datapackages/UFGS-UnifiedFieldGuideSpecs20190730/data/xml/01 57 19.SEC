definition of a hazardous waste as defined by <RID>40 CFR 261</RID> Subparts A, B, C, or D.  Designation of a material by 
this definition, when separately regulated or controlled by other sections or directives, does not eliminate 
the need for adherence to that hazard-specific guidance which takes precedence over this section for "control" 
purposes.  Such material includes ammunition, weapons, explosive actuated devices, propellants, pyrotechnics, 
chemical and biological warfare materials, medical and pharmaceutical supplies, medical waste and infectious 
materials, bulk fuels, radioactive materials, and other materials such as asbestos, mercury, and polychlorinated

<TXT>This definition includes materials such as oily rags, "kitty litter" sorbent clay and organic sorbent material.  
These materials may be land filled provided that:  It is not prohibited in other state regulations or local ordinances; 
the amount generated is "de minimus" (a small amount); it is the result of minor leaks or spills resulting from 
normal process operations; and free-flowing oil has been removed to the practicable extent possible.  Large quantities 
of this material, generated as a result of a major spill or in lieu of proper maintenance of the processing equipment, 
are a solid waste.  As a solid waste, perform a hazardous waste determination prior to disposal.  As this can 
be an expensive process, it is recommended that this type of waste be minimized through good housekeeping practices 
and employee education.</TXT><BRK/>
