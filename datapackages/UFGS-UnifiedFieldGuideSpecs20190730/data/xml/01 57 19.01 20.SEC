<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>state and local 
environmental protection and for environmental temporary controls.  The purpose 
of this document is to supplement Section 01 57 19 TEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS 
with specific State and Local requirements.</SCP> Coordinate with and do not repeat 
what is already provided in the Section <SRF>01 57 19</SRF> TEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS.  
Edit section thoroughly to delete paragraphs not applicable to project.  Use 
this section for both Design-Bid-Build and Design-Build projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
To assist specification editors and Contractors with finding all of the pertinent 
sections, the requirements are arranged by Region, then State and Installation.  
Rather than writing the same State requirement for every installation in a given 
state, the requirement should be listed under that state.  If a requirement 
only applies at a specific installation, list it under the appropriate installation.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Many States and Municipalities have more stringent or additional requirements.  
Modify this section to include State and Local differences as required to suit 
local conditions and regulations.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are: AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for 
District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" submittal 
under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation 
are [for Contractor Quality Control approval.][for information only.  When used, a designation following the
