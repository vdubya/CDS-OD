<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Federal regulations require EPA model accreditation plan training to 
edit this document.  Furthermore, asbestos abatement designers must be accredited 
and licensed to design asbestos work in the location of the construction.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Nonfriable asbestos containing materials do not always require special handling.  
However, during demolition and removal of this material dust and airborne asbestos 
fibers will sometimes be released.  If the project contains nonfriable asbestos 
which may release fibers when demolished and removed, the nonfriable asbestos 
must be removed in the same way as friable asbestos.  Friable ACM must always 
be removed prior to any building demolition.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>OSHA regulations address worker protection, NESHAPS (EPA) regulations address 
disposal requirements, and they have different definitions as to what constitutes 
ACM in wallboard/joint compound systems.  Therefore, where wallboard/joint compound 
are suspected to contain ACM, analyze both discrete samples (separate samples 
from wallboard and joint compound) to address worker protection and composite 
samples (wallboard system as a whole) to address disposal requirements.  It 
is not unusual for the wallboard itself and the wallboard system (taken as a 
whole) to contain less than 1 percent asbestos, but the discrete joint compound 
samples to contain greater than 1 percent asbestos.  Problems can arise if these 
materials are not properly categorized in the design.  Also, if the material 
is applied as an "add on" or "skim coat", NESHAPS considers the layers separate 
and composite sampling is not appropriate.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Asbestos operations do not always indicate negative pressure enclosure type 
asbestos control with all of its attendant requirements.  The location of the 
area, type of material, and initial as well as other exposure assessments for 
abatement workers and the environment must be reviewed and a judgment made by 
the designer as to the precise asbestos control techniques described herein 
that may be safely and legally used.</NPR><BRK/>
<TAI OPT="NAVY"><BRK/>
<NPR>It is the policy of the Navy to eliminate the use of materials containing asbestos 
wherever possible.  Therefore, the designer must not use asbestos containing 
materials wherever a substitute, suitable to the Navy, exists.</NPR><BRK/></TAI>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The limits and conditions of asbestos hazard abatement efforts must be indicated 
on the drawings or in the specification in sufficient detail for the Contractor 
to submit an accurate bid.  Portions of the building where asbestos work will 
take place must be unoccupied during the removal operation.  It is highly recommended 
that the entire building be unoccupied during asbestos hazard abatement operations.  
If portions of the building where asbestos hazard abatement is not taking place 
must remain occupied, additional requirements must be added for providing temporary 
heating/cooling and other utilities to the occupied portions of the building.  
The building heating/cooling system for example cannot be operated in the asbestos 
control area and due to wet removal procedures, electrical service to the asbestos 
control area may need to be shut off and resupplied through a ground fault circuit 
interrupter.  In addition, the rooms with openings into the room undergoing 
asbestos abatement must be empty with critical barriers installed to provide 
a buffer zone.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Provide the following information on the project drawings:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1.  Clearly show location, extent, condition and form of asbestos materials 
to be controlled or in contact with other non-ACM removals or new work.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The work may involve a historic property.  The designer must coordinate 
review of the proposed work with the appropriate cultural resources manager 
(CRM) and cultural resource laws and regulations, as part of the environmental 
review and permitting process.  Consultation with stakeholders, including the 
state historic preservation office, may be required, and work involving historic 
properties will likely be required to confirm to the Secretary of the Interior's 
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (usually at the REHABILITATION 
level).  See <URL>https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-rehabilitation.htm</URL>
